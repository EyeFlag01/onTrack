# onTrack
This is an experiment with communication between virtual worlds and the real one. It is inspired by InWorldz InShape and may evolve into something similar, or into some sort of virtual world game controlled by a phone or other real world controller.  I am interested in any suggestions for such games.

Server.lsl is the inworld object.
Client.py will eventually be replaced by a mobile app.
The QR code generator is a way for the inworld object to display its URL so that it can be read by a mobile app.

So far, this works equally well in OpenSimulator, Halcyon, and Second Life.
