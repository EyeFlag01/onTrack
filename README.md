This is an experiment with communication between virtual worlds and the real one via http. It may evolve into a re-creation of InWorldz Inshape, or into some sort of virtual world game controlled by a real world controller.  I am interested in any suggestions for such games.

So far, it works equally well in Open Simulator, Halcyon, and Second Life.
