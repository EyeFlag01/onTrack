This is an experiment with communication between virtual worlds and the real one via http. It may evolve into a re-creation of InWorldz Inshape, or into some sort of virtual world game controlled by a real world controller.  I am interested in any suggestions for such games.

Server.lsl is the inworld object.
Client.py will eventually be replaced by a mobile app.
The QR code generator is a way for the inworld object to display a URL so that it can be read by a mobile app.

So far, this works equally well in Open Simulator, Halcyon, and Second Life.
